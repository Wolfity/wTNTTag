# wTNTTag
a TNT Tag minigame

### **Introduction**
TNT Tag is a minigame where several players get selected as a tagger. 
When you are the tagger, you have got TNT in your inventory. 
To get rid of the TNT, you have to tag someone. 
Taggers get speed three while non-taggers get a speed two effect. 
After the explosion countdown ends, the taggers will explode, and new taggers will be selected. 

### **How to set it up**
**World Spawn**\
The first thing you have to do is create a world spawn. 
You can do that by typing the command [/tnt setworldspawn]. 
Players will be teleported to that location if they leave the game or if the game ends.

**Lobby and Game Spawns**\
After you create the world spawn, you will have to make a lobby spawn point. 
You can do that by executing the command [/tnt setlobby arenaName]. 
All thatâ€™s left to do now is set a game spawn.
You can do that by using the command [/tnt setspawn arenaName].
